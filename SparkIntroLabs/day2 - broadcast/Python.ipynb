A broadcast variable is sent out to all the executors.\n\n**Q:** When should I use an RDD and when should I use a broadcast variable?  \n**A:** BroadCast variables must fit into RAM (and they're generally under 20 MB).  And they are on all executors.  They're good for small datasets that you can afford to leave in memory on the executors.  RDDs are better for very large datasets that you want to partition and divide up between executors."],"metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"name":"Python","notebookId":15026},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
